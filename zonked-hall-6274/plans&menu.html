            <p>With a selection that spans nourishing breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, the majority of our meals are
                single
                serving and perfectly sized for 1 person to enjoy at 1 sitting. We also offer multi-serve proteins and
                sides,
                which are designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility. These delicious,
                ready-to-heat
                options can help you bulk up existing meals, simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal—the
                choice is
                yours! <br>ld, we do offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s ideal for couples or a family of 4
                looking for 3
                meals per week). Plus, you We offer anywhere from 4–12 meals per week, with meals as low as $8.99
                each—and you always have the freedom to
                flex your number of meals up each week to add on breakfast items*, which are unlocked upon your second
                order. On
                average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger
                househocan always order multiple subscriptions. We may be biased, but there’s no better
                feeling than a fridge full of Freshly! <br>*Each breakfast item counts towards your 12-meal maximum.

        <div class="accordion">How long do the meals last?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they have a refrigerated shelf life of
                about 3-5
                days. Select items (such as seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on the package to let
                you know.
                We usually suggest enjoying these meals within the first few days of receiving your order, but you can
                always
                check their exact use-by date on the back-of-pack nutrition label. If you’re ever unable to finish your
                meals
                within their shelf life, you can always pop them into the freezer for extended storage. Just be sure to
                microwave your meal straight from the freezer and add a few extra minutes to reach the 165° F internal
                temperature we recommend.</p>

        <div class="accordion">How do I heat up my meals?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to heat ‘em up in the microwave. On the back
                of each
                meal, you’ll find our easy steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3 minutes
                (depending on
                your microwave). If you’re unsure, start at 2 minutes and heat in 30–second increments until the meal
                reaches an
                inner temperature of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to be heated in the microwave (for the ultimate
                convenience), but you can heat them in the oven if you’d like. Just so you know, our current meal
                containers
                aren’t safe for the oven or stovetop, so you’ll have to transfer your food to heat it up.</p>

        <div class="accordion">How does shipping work?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>To help guarantee your meals arrive in the freshest condition, there is a small shipping fee associated
                with your
                order. We deliver to all states within the continental U.S., and our shipping partners offer delivery
                every day
                of the week. The exact days that we can reach you will depend on your ZIP code and the carrier

                Freshly meals. Whether you're signing up or updating your typical delivery day, we'll show you all the
